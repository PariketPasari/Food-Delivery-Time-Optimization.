# Food Delivery Time Optimization.

## Problem Statement

This project aims to accurately predict food delivery times by considering factors like weather conditions, traffic density, and vehicle condition using Deep learning architecture 

## Goal 

The goal of this project is to leverage deep learning, particularly LSTM models, to predict food delivery times with high accuracy. By understanding and analyzing the complex relationships within the dataset, the model aims to optimize delivery operations, enhance customer satisfaction, and streamline the overall food delivery process.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of various features such as delivery person details, location coordinates, order information, weather conditions, traffic density, and more. Each record includes a unique identifier, and the target variable is the time taken for the delivery in minutes. This dataset provides a comprehensive view of the factors influencing food delivery times, making it suitable for training a deep learning model.

## EDA & Visualization 

### Key Findings

### Order Insights:
- **Uniform Order Type Distribution:** All cities exhibit nearly equal distribution among order types, indicating consistent preferences across locations.
- **Consistent Order Times:** Average order times are evenly distributed across cities, suggesting standardized efficiency in food delivery services.

### City-wise Trends:
- **Jaipur Dominance:** Jaipur records the highest number of orders and traffic density, outperforming other cities.
- **Lower Order Numbers in Specific Cities:** Agra, Ludhiana, Kanpur, Delhi, Aligarh, Kolkata, Aurangabad, Kochi, Goa, and Bhopal exhibit a similar trend with lower order numbers.

### Delivery Person:
- **Youthful Workforce:** The majority of delivery persons fall within the age range of 20 to 40 years.
- **High Ratings:** Delivery persons commonly receive ratings between 4 to 5, with 4.5 being the most frequent rating.

### Time-Distance Relationship:
- **Efficient Delivery:** A consistent relationship exists between time taken and distance traveled, with most deliveries completed within 25-30 minutes.

### Traffic and Location Insights:
- **Metropolitan Traffic:** Metropolitan cities experience more significant traffic congestion compared to urban and semi-urban areas.
- **Traffic Congestion and Festivals:** Higher traffic congestion is observed during non-festival periods, with potential traffic reduction during festivals.
- **Urban vs. Semi-Urban Delivery Times:** Semi-urban cities have higher delivery times compared to metropolitan cities.

### Operational Impact:
- **Delivery Load Impact:** A higher number of deliveries result in longer delivery times, emphasizing the need for load management.
  
### Weather and Vehicle Impact:
- **Weather Conditions and Delivery Times:** Cloudy and foggy weather conditions lead to longer delivery times compared to other weather conditions.
- **Motorcycle Delivery Times:** Motorcycles surprisingly have higher delivery times compared to other modes of transportation.

### Festival Period Impact:
- **Festival Impact on Delivery Times:** During festivals, delivery times are significantly higher than during non-festival seasons, highlighting operational challenges during peak demand.

## Model Used

We employed a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning model for predicting food delivery times. LSTMs are particularly suitable for this task due to their ability to capture sequential dependencies in data, retain historical context, adapt to temporal patterns, and handle variable time intervals between order events.

### Reasons for Selecting LSTM Model

- **Sequencing Delivery Events:** LSTMs adeptly capture the sequence of delivery events, crucial for predicting accurate food delivery times.
- **Retaining Historical Context:** LSTMs remember information from past deliveries, enabling the model to understand how historical events impact current delivery times.
- **Adapting to Temporal Patterns:** Effective at learning and adapting to temporal patterns specific to food delivery, considering factors like peak hours, day-of-week trends, and seasonal variations.
- **Handling Variable Time Intervals:** LSTMs accommodate irregular time intervals between order placement, preparation, and delivery, aligning with the dynamic nature of food delivery.
- **Learning from Previous Order Experiences:** LSTMs continuously improve predictions by learning from past order experiences, adjusting for factors that consistently influence delivery times.

## Final Outcome

### Performance & Testing

- The adoption of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks played a crucial role in our project for predicting food delivery times. LSTMs, known for capturing sequential dependencies, align seamlessly with the dynamic nature of our data. The architecture includes LSTM layers for sequencing and dense layers for predictions, totaling 117,619 trainable parameters, showcasing the model's robust capacity for learning complex relationships within the data.
